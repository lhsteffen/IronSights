# IronSights

## Vision/Intended Application

IronSights is a mobile application created for both Android and IOS platforms 
using Google's Flutter SDK. IronSights is a weight tracking app meant to help 
those who wish to keep track of the weight of any lift the user desires. IronSights 
will also allow the user to create weekly routines composed of that user's created 
lifts. Routines can be selected as a main routine and displayed on the home 
page for a user to follow during daily workouts. IronSights is meant to be a 
fairly simple and intuitive app meant for those who already have a workout 
and lifts planned, and it does not come with any preplanned workouts, routines, 
or lifts. IronSights, in essence, is little more than a logbook that can be easily 
navigated and changed meant for those who wish the record the weigths of their 
various lifts and their routines without having to deal with the hassle of overly 
cluttered apps, a simple notepad app, or stacks of paper.
